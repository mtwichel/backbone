# The Backbone Dart Backend Framework

A Dart framework for writing REST APIs from an Open API spec.

---

> NOTE: This framework is very early in its development. Use at your own risk ðŸ˜Ž

A huge shoutout to the [mason package](https://pub.dev/packages/mason), the [open_api_forked package](https://pub.dev/packages/open_api_forked) and the [shelf package](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf)! This package uses them heavily in its implementation, and it would be much more challenging to build without them.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Make sure you have Dart installed on your computer. If you have Flutter installed, you probably also have Dart installed. You can check by running:

```bash
dart --version
```

If it is not, you can download it [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Also, make sure the version is >= `2.12.0`;

2. Install backbone by running

```bash
dart pub global activate backbone
```

### Usage

1. Create a new file called `openapi.yaml`.

2. Define your API using the [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification), or copy the example spec.

3. In the folder your spec resides, run the following command:

```bash
backbone new
```

4. When the command finishes, you should see three new folders.

5. As you update the spec, you can run the following command to update the API:

```bash
backbone generate
```

## The Generated Code

The backbone generator looks in your supplied `openapi.yaml` and generates three dart packages for you automatically:

1. The `backend` package. This is the code that will run on the server and server your API.
2. The `functions_objects` package. This contains objects used by the backend and frontend to communicate with each other. You can think of this as the bridge between the frontend and backend.
3. The `fontend_packages/[API_NAME]` package. This is a frontend wrapper around your API so it can be easily called from Flutter code.

The `functions_objects` and `frontend_packages/[API_NAME]` packages are completely generated by the generator, so you will never need to edit them manually.

The `backend` package has a lot of code generated by backbone, but you will still have to write the functionality of your API.

## Writing your API

After initial generation, you should see a file `backend/lib/[API_NAME].dart`. This is where your API endpoint functions will go.

> NOTE: Your functions only need to be exported from this file, not nessesarily written there directly. You can write your functions anywhere in the `backend` package, just make sure they get exported from this file.

The signature of the function you need to write is different depending on if the request contains a body and if there are parameters to the request. Instead of remembering the rules, check out the `backend/functions.md` file. It lists all the functions your API expects to be exposed, and you can copy and paste them from there and into your source code.

### Writing your endpoint functions

#### RequestObject

If your request contains a body, your function will receive an object called `[OPERATION-ID]Request`. This is a simple Dart object that will contain the information passed to the request via the body.

#### RequestParameters

If your request has any parameters defined (from the path, query, or headers), your function will receive an object called `[OPERATION-ID]Parameters`. This is a simple Dart object that will contain the parameters passed into the request.

#### ResponseObject

All requests must return a `200` response, and your functions must return a object of type `[OPERATION-ID]Response`. It can also return a Future of that object instead if you'd like your function to be async.

#### RequestContext

The request context is passed to every function. It currently contains

- `rawRequest`: This is the shelf [Request](https://pub.dev/documentation/shelf/latest/shelf/Request-class.html) object, which contains all data about the request including headers and more.
- `logger`: This is a `RequestLogger` object that can be used to log requests. If running locally, it will print logs out to the console; if running on Google Cloud Run, it will format logs for Cloud Logging. You can use it like this:

```dart
Future<GetPuppiesResponse> getPuppies(RequestContext context) async{
  context.logger.info('Getting puppies');
}
```

## Other Topics

### Testing your API

Since each endpoint is simply one function, you can easily unit test it using Dart's [test package](https://pub.dev/packages/test). Simply mock the request and request context (we prefer [mocktail package](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) for this, but anything should work).

### Debugging your API

Since your API is just Dart code, you can debug it using the Dart debugging tools you're familiar with.

In fact, if you open to your `backend` package in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), in the "Run and Debug" tab, you can start debugging your API by just clicking run.

### Deploying your API

WIP

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Full support for multipart form data requests
- [ ] Auto-generate Dockerfile for deployment
- [ ] Include a mock request context and mock logger
- [ ] Support for dependency injection using the request context
- [ ] Support for middleware
